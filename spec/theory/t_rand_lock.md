# Randomization and locking

Randomization in *Top Down Sprite Maker* is represented by the ![](./assets/random.png) icon.

Randomization can occur at multiple levels: color selection, layer, or the sprite
style itself.

Randomizing a color selection

    Randomizing the value of a color selection is quite trivial. The color is
    assigned to one of the color selection's swatches at random.

Randomizing a layer

    All layers can be randomized. Layers of different types process randomization
    differently. Please read the dedicated page about layers to learn more about
    layer types.

    Choice layers

        Chooses one of the choice texts at random

    Math layers

        Chooses a random value from within the layer's minimum and maximum bounds

    Color selection layers

        Each color selection in the layer is randomized

    Asset choice layers

        An asset choice layer consists of one or more assets (images) to choose
        from. A hairstyle layer is an obvious example. Asset choice layers may
        include a "no choice" option, where not choosing any asset is a valid
        choice. As per our example, this might be the way a sprite style represents
        baldness as a choice.

        Asset choice layers that support a "no choice" option must define logic
        that determines the randomization behaviour of no choice. Such layers can
        either assign an explicit percentage chance of randomization coming up
        with no choice, or can treat "no choice" as any other choice and give them
        equal odds of being assigned by randomization.

Randomizing a sprite style

    An entire character can be randomized at once by clicking the die in the top-
    right corner of the customization screen. Clicking this die will sequentially
    randomize every one of a sprite style's customization layers that isn't locked.

    Layers that are locked are exempted from randomization.


## Randomization

## Locking

Locking a layer excludes it from style-level randomization. This is an effective strategy for
constraining randomization.

Constraining randomization means to control certain variables and characteristics
of a customization. When such layers are locked, their value will persist when
the sprite style is randomized. For example, if you want to randomize a sprite
style, but you want the hairstyle, hat, and skin color to remain the same, you can
simply lock those layers and click the die in the top-right corner. The result
will be a newly randomized set of traits, but those defined by locked layers will
remain the same.
