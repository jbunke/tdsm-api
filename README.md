# *Top Down Sprite Maker* | Scripting API

This repository houses the [specification](./spec/README.md) and [implementation](./src/com/jordanbunke/tdsm_api) of the [*application programing interface*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (API) for scripts in [*Top Down Sprite Maker*](https://github.com/jbunke/tdsm), a pixel art character customization program that supports multiple art styles and fully configurable sprite sheets.
